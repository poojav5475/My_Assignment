    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides methods and techniques to make inferences and draw conclusions about populations or phenomena based on a sample of data. Statistics is broadly divided into two main categories: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics: This branch involves summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. Measures such as mean (average), median, mode, range, and standard deviation are used to describe the central tendency, variability, and distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics: This branch deals with making predictions, inferences, or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. It includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics helps researchers make statements about a larger group based on the characteristics of a smaller subset."

    "1. Nominal Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Definition: Nominal data consist of categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking. It represents qualitative data where numbers are used to label categories without any quantitative significance.\n",

    "1. Nature of Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nominal Data: In nominal data, categories represent labels or names for different groups or entities. The categories have no inherent order or ranking.\n",

    "* Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",
