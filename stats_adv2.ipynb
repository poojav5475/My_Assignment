    "* Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "     The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value. It assigns probabilities to individual outcomes of a discrete random variable. For a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X=x), representing the probability that X takes on the value x. The PMF satisfies two properties: non-negativity and the sum of probabilities over all possible outcomes is equal to 1.\n",

    "     The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range. Unlike the PMF, the PDF doesn't give the probability of a specific value but provides the relative likelihood of observing values within an interval. The PDF is denoted as f(x), and the probability of X falling in the interval (a,b) is given by the integral of f(x) over that interval. The area under the PDF curve represents probabilities, and the total area is equal to 1.\n",
